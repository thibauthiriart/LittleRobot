# **LittleRobot**
This project is a little controled robot

There are 2 big steps to complete this project: 
  1. 3d design , print and build
  2. softwear desing and code

## **Build**
For the 3d design most of the file come from the plen project but they are all modified to be able to adapt well to European parts (servomotors).Some pieces are made by hand.
This step are done and the little robot is built.
We are using this electronic card and this servomotors.
